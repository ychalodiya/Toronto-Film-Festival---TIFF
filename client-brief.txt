Client: TIFF (Toronto International Film Festival)

Client Brief
============
TIFF has hired you to create an application that highlights new
films being released around the world this year.

TIFF wants you to display all the films being released in the current year in
release order. When a user selects one, they want you to provide the film's
description, genres, tag line (if any), and runtime.

In order to limit the inclusion of lower quality films in the list TIFF wants
you to exclude any films with a popularity value less than 10.

If you have time, also provide a feature that allows the user to see the cast
of the films and be able to display other movies that they have appeared in.

Use the provided style guide.
